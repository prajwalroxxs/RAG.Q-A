# 💬 **Loan Approval Q&A Chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

An **intelligent chatbot** that answers user questions related to loan approvals by leveraging **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

This system combines:

- 🔍 **Context Retrieval** using **FAISS** and **MiniLM embeddings**
- 🤖 **Natural Language Generation** using **Google’s FLAN-T5 model** from Hugging Face

The chatbot enables users to ask questions in natural language and get **contextual, informative answers** based on the knowledge extracted from the `training.csv` dataset.


## 🧠 **Example Questions**

Ask natural, human-like questions such as:

- “Do graduates have a better chance of loan approval?”
- “Do married applicants have better approval chances?”
- “How does income level influence the decision?”
